=======

GIS Day provides an international forum for users of GIS technology to demonstrate real-world applications that are making a difference in our society. This year it is November 19, 2014. 

This repository is the map of participants and events. It is an open & collaborative project that we encourage you to share your ideas, code and design to make the experience the best possible to encourage your local communities to join a local event and learn about GIS.

## Contributing

Anyone can contribute to this project. Depending on your time and expertise you can contribute in a few ways:

- Write code to add or improve a feature. For example add an address locator, geolocation near me, or on-hover information windows
- Design and User Experience to make the map compelling on desktop and mobile devices
- Identify issues with functionality, locations on the map, or participant information.

## How to Contribute

You can start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/ArcGIS/gis-day/issues). Please provide detailed information on your idea or the bug and include a screenshot, wireframe or even whiteboard or paper sketch.

If you want to modify the code or HTML/CSS, you should submit a "Pull Request" (or _PR_). This will be reviewed and commented and improved and once approved we will merge it into the live version. Pull Requests are best when they are small, succinct changes and only need to take a few minutes. By small iterative changes we can progressively build a better map. For example, if you want to propose a new marker icon, submit a Pull Request with just that change. 

To submit a Pull Request, first you should [click the "Fork"](https://github.com/ArcGIS/gis-day/fork) button to make your own copy. You can then clone the repository (copy) to your computer and modify. You then push it to your copy on GitHub and finally submit a "Pull Request". 

It is easiest to submit a pull-request from your `gh-pages` branch so that we can verify the functionality by visiting `http://username.github.io/gis-day`. 

Also, if you are responding to an existing issue, please include "Resolves #issue" where `#issue` is the issue number. This will cross-link to the issue as well as close the issue when your Pull Request is accepted.  

For more details, see [Esri Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/esri/contributing) or [GitHub's notes on Forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to see this in detail.
