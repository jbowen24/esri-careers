## How to Contribute

You can start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/ArcGIS/gis-day/issues). Please provide detailed information on your idea or the bug and include a screenshot, wireframe or even whiteboard or paper sketch.

If you want to modify the code or HTML/CSS, you should submit a "Pull Request" (or _PR_). This will be reviewed and commented and improved and once approved we will merge it into the live version. Pull Requests are best when they are small, succinct changes and only need to take a few minutes. By small iterative changes we can progressively build a better map. For example, if you want to propose a new marker icon, submit a Pull Request with just that change. 

To submit a Pull Request, first you should [click the "Fork"](https://github.com/ArcGIS/gis-day/fork) button to make your own copy. You can then clone the repository (copy) to your computer and modify. You then push it to your copy on GitHub and finally submit a "Pull Request". 

For more details, see [Esri Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/esri/contributing) or [GitHub's notes on Forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to see this in detail.
